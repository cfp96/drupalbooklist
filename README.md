# drupalbooklist
This is a Drupal instance with a custom module designed to retrieve relevant information from the Open Library API. The project is created in Pantheon, a platform that supports website development and hosting. For Linux, you can use Lando to run the project locally, or Aquia Dev Desktop, which also works on Windows. If you'd like, I can add you to the Pantheon platform so you can access the logs and review the changes. Please send me a message if you're interested.

If you're using Linux, you can follow a helpful tutorial by Eric at Pantheon on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0CEFiGqzxM&t=375s). Additionally, you can refer to the documentation for instructions on installing Lando on your machine (https://docs.lando.dev/getting-started/installation.html).

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance."
